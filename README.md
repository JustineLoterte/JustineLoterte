# 👋 Hi there, I'm Justine R. Loterte !

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a **2nd Year BSIT student** fueled by curiosity and a love for technology. I thrive on turning ideas into working solutions, exploring new programming languages, tinkering with databases, and discovering tools that make coding fun and efficient.  

When I'm not coding, you'll find me experimenting with tech projects, solving challenging problems, or learning something new to level up my skills.
